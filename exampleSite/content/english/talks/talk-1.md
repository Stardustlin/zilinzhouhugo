The "old" Milanno and "new" Milano
</div>

Milan is the first destination in the journey of Italian architecture. Compared with the tranquility of Delft village, it is full of summer heat and joy. Milan Cathedral and Central Railway Station are the landmarks of thsi city, declaring the sovereignty of architecture at the moment people arrive.

#####  Ca' Brutta Residential Building 
Ca' Brutta was designed by architect Giovanni Muzio in the 1920s. It uses a large amount of architectural classical language and is called the architectural manifesto of the art movement. The building is split into the courtyard from the middle, and the facades are connected by arches. The arches, columns, and round holes of the facade are probably variants of Palladio's motif, and these abstract and simplified elements are also used on the facade.

“The façade is characterized by the use of different materials, the lower layer is travertine, the middle layer is cement, and the upper layer is Vicenza plaster of quicklime and marble. ”[1]

At the end of the courtyard of Ca' Brutta is an ordinary residential building, with the same simple molding, embellished green plants, and the color is just right and gentle.

#####  Padiglione D'Arte Contemporanea
The Museum of Contemporary Art is a temporary exhibition hall of contemporary art designed by Ignazio Gardella in 1953 [2]. The light from the outside grass enters the room through the large glass windows, and is ingeniously integrated with the artificial light inside, forming a wonderful difference in warm and cold tones. And this warm and cold feeling is also reflected in the texture of the wooden floor inside and the concrete floor next to the window.

The outdoor façade was initially thought to be an unfinished protective frame. It is now speculated that the interior may be a vertically sliding shutter screen designed by the architect to adjust the light in the exhibition hall. Of course, it may also be a protective net to prevent glass windows from being smashed.

#####  Santuario di San Bernardino alle Ossa 

This is a church where human bones are stored, and the skull basically covers the entire wall of the church.
In the 12th century, the hospital not far from the church became a refuge for abandoned children in the city, and the nearby cemetery was used to bury the dead in the hospital. Later, people realized that there was not enough space in the cemetery, so they built rooms to collect all the bones in the cemetery [3].

#####  Duomo di Milano
After climbing more than a hundred steps, I finally clocked in to the flying buttresses of Milan Cathedral. The towering minarets did indeed have the spirit of pointing straight to heaven. The white scaffolding on the roof formed a new spire, which roughly intruded into the church.

#####  Bosco Verticale
The Milan Vertical Forest designed by Stefano Boeri Architetti is the world's first vertical forest architecture [4]. The extended outdoor platforms of different sizes and heights are planted with shrubs, small trees, and large numbers. Seven years have passed since the completion of the project in 14 years, and trees can be seen growing lush.

Interestingly, the vertical forest in Milan seems to be an exaggerated version of Milan's ordinary architecture. Walking on the streets of Milan, you can see green gardens on the roof, potted plants on the balcony, and climbing vines on the walls. Ecology seems to be an element that has long been integrated into the lives of Milanese.

#####  Fondazione Prada 
The Prada Foundation, designed by Rem Koolhaas, is located in the former gin distillery in 1910 [5]. Koolhaas retained the existing buildings and built new buildings into the park, including warehouses, laboratories and brewing silos, as well as new buildings surrounding the large courtyard.

The newly-built temporary exhibition hall is connected to the old building. When you go to the basement to store your bags, you can see the soft light spilt through the grille when you look up, and the texture of the wall is subtlely highlighted.

The silver impact honeycomb aluminum ceiling, the thin mullions, and the one-way wood grain all lead the eyes to the old outdoor buildings. The light penetrates the grille into the exhibition hall, and is reflected on the suspended ceiling, forming a color gradation.

In the permanent exhibition hall, each floor is a separate exhibition hall, where you can see the excellent exterior scenery of different heights.
