—— Curtain Wall Glass Flattening and Standardized Parametric Design ——

How to reduce the cost while ensuring the surface shape through parametric design?

The subtle adjustments brought about by the parameter changes, like the butterfly effect, will cause more problems in the next fabrication process. The building itself is an industry that requires multi-party collaboration. Design, prefabrication, and final on-site construction are difficult to achieve through a platform to form the entire process of data transmission. This leads to the progress of each step means the rework of the previous step, and the accumulated error value will affect the final appearance of the building.

In the optimization process, I first flattened the curved glass, secondly controlled the glass unit size within the processable range, and finally numbered the glass processing sequence to unify the information flow from overall design to construction.

There are several ways to simplify the curved glass curtains. For example, the control curvess are all planar and only move in Z Axis, or they are all planar but can move in X&Y Axis, or they can move in any direction. The more freedom we give to the control curves, the more difficult and expensive the fabrication will be.

So. How to flatten curved glass and reduce processing waste? This is a real problem I encountered in the optimization of the curtain wall of the Golden Eagle complex, and the following are the solutions.

<div style="text-align: center">
—— Test 1 Rectangular flat glass ——
</div>

I test the rectangular flat glass which is easy to manufacture glass panels. However, the disadvantage is that the structural panel behind will not be flat if I just consider the front glass panel. Another disadvantage is that the glass width is random and will exceed the conventional curtain wall glass width limitation. The next step is to control or uniform the width of glass panels and also flatten structural panels.

<div style="text-align: center">
—— Test 2 Flatten all the panels ——
</div>

I try to flatten both the glass panels and the structural panels behind. The glass width is random and will exceed the conventional curtain wall glass width limitation. Then I try to control the width of the glass panel.

Through the adjustment of unit rotate angle, it can help me to control the maximun glass width. The changeable facade unit angles also help me to create the athestics of the facade. Then I subdivide the glass for the fabrication preparation. Every glass unit width is under 2 meters. The support rod is added to support the glass curtain, it can also help to adjust glass width to a normalized value.
