We are not living the normal life which our parents had and got strapped away from us. Following the global nuclear war of 2055, nature seems to be taking control and dominate over the once heavy urbanized cities.

Humans are hesitant and do not trust the ideology of a main political structure which usually forget the individual and the connections between its members. Instead, they flock in small numbers and are highly dependant on one another to survive in these new harsh conditions. Radioactivity levels are still high, especially the first ten meters above the streets, giving rise to unimaginably dangerous creatures. 
This lead for one particular nomadic tribe to look upwards, not be scared of heights and thriving in previously unreachable places.
The human body, weakened by previous generations of office work and sitting down, can not adapt as quick to perform according to these new demands to survive in such critical condition.

The organic skeletal structure allocates for the system to expand according to specific needs, consequently expanding further the potential use of the gripers. the  Having to constantly move while keeping away from the ground, the Lagartixas’ hybrid system takes full advantage of this to attach  other emergent technologies which are to their benefit.

**Fruit collector**<br>
When a desired destination is reached, the grippers are immediately activated to attach to any unstable or vertical surfaces. The skeletal structure embracing their body acts like an exoskeleton, relieving the Lagartixas’ bones and muscles from excessive and prolonged strain.

Tools or any other resources which are found on the way can be  attached or released to/from the body with the grippers themselves. In this case the whole body becomes a canvas where the most important items are quickly gathered or deployed.

This hybrid system enabled the Lagartixas to not only survive but also thrive. After a long session of fruit picking, this Lagartixa decides to take a quick moment to daydream on the day when the ground plane will be free and habitable again. All her resources are attached to her and ready to for her next destination to call home.
