**This is a collaboration of architecture with archaeological stratigraphy and that engenders a monument for place and memory.**

The law of superposition in archaeological stratigraphy bears a strong resemblance to the layering in architecture. Through thousands of years, the layers of the stratum are stacked and transpressed, forming a huge historical cultural section. Remains in stratum break through the boundaries between layers and layers, bringing the past to the present.

Through introducing stratigraphy to the historic city, an underground monument is created. As the most important remains, the city wall is transformed into an architectural-scale prototype though topology analysis, while connecting fIoors of different height.
 
The upright city wall that brings the staggered layers and the texture on it evokes people of memory and history. The inverted city wall allows the worm sunshine to gradually penetrate into the underground space and diffuse, greatly facilitating a holy perception.

Nanjing as an cultural and historical city has been the capital for several dynasties, such as Six dynasty, South dynasty and Ming dynasty. Geographically, the city walls enclose the city's boundaries of three dynasties. This project's site is located right in the center of the overlapping city wall boundaries.

When visiting the Six Dynasty Museum in Nanjing, I was shocked by the underground archaelogical strata inside. At that moment, I seemed to feel the thousands of years of history and culture condensed in the soils. The law of superposition in archaeological stratigraphy bears a strong resemblance to the layering in architecture. The archaeological statum is created by accumulating previous cultural layers. The superposition principle refIects on both geological remains and accumulations of human cultural activities.

The city wall, as an element connecting the three dynasties's history, is integrated into the city life. I conducted a typological analysis and deformation by studying the sections of the city wall, and applied them to this Inverted City Monument's plan and section design. As gradually moving to the underground, the fIoors went from separation to squeezing. It could be concluded as three spatial forms: detached panels with bridges, overlap parts as connection points, and integrated squeezed space. These three types of spatial forms overlapped upon each other through the connection of city walls.

**Memory Strata**
The site is like an excavated archeological site, carrying people's memories of rough history.The inverted city wall of liight echoes the distant remains. <br>
**Dissociation**
When walking down, the detached fIoors feel like fragments of memory. Skylight fIoods down from the inverted city walls, transporting the visitor to an immersive experience.<br>
**Touchment**
The light began to dim and led people into a peaceful world, where you can read the stories of each dynasty. People can feel connected with the histories.<br>
**Extrusion**
With the approach deeper underground, multiple walls extrude with each other generating rich spaces. People walk down as if entering a sanctuary full of ruins, and the light penetrates gently into depths of memory.<br>
