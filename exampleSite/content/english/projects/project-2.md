**This is an intertwining of urbanity and placeness, an exploration of context regeneration and place-making.**

The project focuses on the analogy between urbanity and architecture. The old town is weaved with streets in different scales and directions, dividing the island into multiple small plots, forming a complex and organic urban texture that extended into architecture.

Inspired by the Stockholm Street Mapping on the Sweden Expo Pavilion, the existing urban texture within the site is transformed into a smaller-scale so as to create a street atmosphere inside the architecture.

At the same time, considering the unique roof tour on-foot featuring Stockholm, the roof form has been highlighted into a new prototype. The variation of roof lines reveal two sets of logic systems facing both the outer street and the inner building itself. These designs will give visitors a unique experience of ancient and modern in the timber center space.

Through analysis of the streets in Gamla Stan, the urban texture could be simplified into street relationships. Then the texture is adapted into a smaller-scale one inside the site, connecting the streets around the site so as to introduce the genus loci into the architecture.

Due to the research on Stockholm's roof structures, the new prototype emerged from the deformation of trusses.The roof derives its form from triangular folded plates with different angles and scales to create rich space. The roof structure is comprised of two rings of variable-sectioned trusses, the outer one echoing the historic buildings opposite across the street, therefore in quite a regular contour, while the inner one creating fIexible and interesting interior spaces, in this way enriched with more varied forms.

Timber as the main material was manufactured into trusses, beams, walls, floor panels and interior decorations. The components can be recycled and replaced on site through the robotic fabrication.
