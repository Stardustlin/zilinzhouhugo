Wuhan in the post-epidemic era is experiencing urban recovery and nirvana, and is constantly balancing the symbiotic relationship between ecological civilization and technological development. Longquan Mountain and Jiufeng Mountain, as important north-south nodes of Wuhan's central ecological corridor, are an important part of urban ecology.

The shape of the city balcony on the top of the mountain can give a panoramic view of the light of science and technology of the rising Optics Valley Central City.

As an urban balcony, Jiufeng Rainbow is suspended on the top of Jiufeng in the form of a ring of ecology and technology, overlooking the Optics Valley. The design inspiration comes from the rainbow halo after the wind and rain, which means the new life of Wuhan. The simple and powerful steel structure supports the circular walkway, and the overall smooth shape is full of space and futuristic sense.

At the same time, the Feihong Ring Road provides climbers with different heights to walk in the forest. The wooden terrace at the top of Jiufeng Rainbow, as a part of the mountaintop trail, allows hikers to freely overlook the future center of Optics Valley. The indoor arc-shaped stand with a cliff is picked out, which has an excellent viewing field and comfortable experience.

A variety of forest landscape nodes are also designed on the mountaineering path of Jiufeng Mountain, so that visitors can enjoy the beauty of nature. The 360-degree open circular trail is integrated with the mountains and forests. Lightweight wooden pillars support the plank road, making it a new life form in the mountains.
