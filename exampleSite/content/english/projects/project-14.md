Wuhan in the post-epidemic era is experiencing urban recovery and nirvana, and is constantly balancing the symbiotic relationship between ecological civilization and technological development. Longquan Mountain and Jiufeng Mountain, as important north-south nodes of Wuhan's central ecological corridor, are an important part of urban ecology. The shape of the city balcony on the top of the mountain can give a panoramic view of the light of science and technology of the rising Optics Valley Central City.
