**This is a collaboration between topology and architecture, a manifesto for endless possibilities for space design with filament winding structure.**

Like the butterfIy effect, a little fIap of weaving points will create continuous topological variation that engenders infinite spatial experiences. These topologies can be transformed into different scales for human use and mudular systems accordingly. 

Inspired by ICD's experiments on filament winding structure design and the studio "Material Performance" in GSD, the final design is achieved by simulating woven carbon fiber and glass fiber with a robotic arm, so that the weave pattern means not only a decoration, but a space with internal structural characteristics. Throughout the process, we constantly adjust the fiber weaving sequence and perform stress analysis of mechanics to obtain the most aesthetic form and the design prototype that best fits in the structural logic.

Weaving is an art from simple to complex. All the steps can be summarized as the connection of points, then the curves forms various surfaces. Considering that the curvature of the minimal surface is 0 and the area is the smallest, the thread can be fully cross-overlaid, and the stability is stronger. We adopted a variant of the saddle surface as the prototype. Through the study of different modules and scales, this prototype can be transformed into various space elements such as seats, tables, pillars, exhibition halls, etc.

Before the actual model construction, we tested the 1:2 acrylic model: whether the support is stable enough for robotic fabrication and whether the weaving sequence is effective.

The weaving system is divided into three layers according to material and structural requirements. First, glass fiber is used to outline the overall minimal surface, then carbon fiber with extremely high tensile strength is cross-woven to reinforce the surface, and finally carbon fiber is again used to reinforce the corners. Therefore, the entire design can be completed with only three threads.

With the KUKA|prc plugin in grasshopper, I tested the simulation of the robot arm path. To prevent collisions between the robot and the mold, two path points are added above each weaving path.
