Paper as a sustainable material with advantages such as extremely lightweight, easy to fabricate and recyclable, has been everywhere in our daily life. What if we can recycle waste paper and make it into an environmentally-friendly and high-performance paper architecture?

Through fireproof and waterproof processing, recycled paper can be translated into structures, walls, insulations and facades, which replace the regular high carbon emission materials of ordinary buildings. Owe to the recyclability and sustainability of paper fibers, paper can again be used in new engineered elements at the end of its lifespan. So, actually, paper architecture stores carbon in the whole building life cycle to help deal with the urban heat island effect.

After research of properties and cases, several paper products for architectural prototype are proposed: paper core and paper tube truss for structure, paper honeycomb panel and paper cellulose for high-thermal walls, and molded paper composite for façade.

With this paper design tool, I proposed a design for BK faculty to reduce the Urban Heat Island Effect through the use of innovative materials that could have a complete circular life cycle. In BK’s history, it was always changing and breaking through. And as an innovative and experimental faculty, it will need more flexible space in the future. I think it will be a new campus village with living, experimenting and creating for designers and engineers. The different lifespans of paper architecture prototype can satisfy the students’ requirements for permanent apartments, semi-permanent experimental space and temporary pavilions.

Besides the recyclable features, this prototype has two more noticeable advantages. Firstly, due to the extremely light weight of paper, the partition walls made of paper honeycomb and wood panel can be over 20 times lighter than the concrete wall, which reduces transportation consumption and is more convenient for installation. This provides strong flexibility to the student apartments on this site, and students can freely design and change the space plan. Secondly, due to paper’s easy processing and high strength characteristics, it can be manufactured into structural components of free shape and size, providing innovative structural potentials. For example, through the paper winding operation, paper core with circular or convex polygonal cross sections can have 2m maximum diameter and 6m maximum length, the span of paper truss can reach 40m, which has been proven to be temporary building structures in Shigeru Ban’s projects. This easy processing characteristic of paper provides the potential for huge lightweight flexible space and aesthetic pavilion space, where students can make digital fabrication and exhibit their design products.

Here we can see the perfect fusion of new paper architecture and this experimental and innovative faculty. As a catalyst, this sustainable, flexible and aesthetic paper architecture definitely will provide a space full of creativity and imagination, inspiring these designers here to think about the future of architecture and environment.

With this paper design tool, I look into the urban context. The permanent apartment is a standalone wing, echoing old BK building. And I put semi-permanent laboratory along the street for easy transport and exhibition for public. The temporary paper pavilion help to activate the space around Bouwpub for students.
Three constructions have different lifespans, structures and climate zones, but they echo and interact with each other in space. When walking in it, people may feel amazed that paper can create so many different aesthetics forms of architecture. They can touch the paper composite façade of the permanent apartment, they can walk in the laboratory with delicate paper truss systems, and they can enjoy the light through the paper tube pavilions.

**Permanent Apartment**<br>
First is the Prototype for apartment. Due to the limitation of paper’s strength, I choose glulam timber as the main loadbearing structure. But the walls and floors are made by paper honeycomb and solid cardboard panels, which can be over 20 times lighter than the concrete wall. The facades are made by paper composite which can be molded in any shape, giving the aesthetics to the building.

**Semi-permanent Laboratory**<br>
Second is the Prototype for semi-permanent laboratory. The paper tube truss with 12 meters span supported by paper core with 800 mm diameters. Also considering the wind load, steel cables are added between these wood joints.

**Temporary Paper Pavilion**<br>
The third is the prototype for temporary pavilion. The tubes can be both the structure and roof by parametrically adjusting their thickness and length. The joints are connected through steel plates and the foundation is strengthened by 3d printing concrete.

**Detail**<br>
Water barrier membranes are considered both inside and outside. And to maintain the interior temperature, I add paper cellulose insulation outside the paper honeycomb walls. Breathing window devices are installed for exchange air and recovery heat.
For the connection between apartments and laboratory, the structures are independent but the skin and space is connected. Here is a big and high gutter to store the rain water and prevent water pouring into the wall. The structure is connected with paper tube and fixed by adding steel plates.

Here are some still unsolved problems of paper architecture: Can paper become a structural material as strong as steel? Can paper materials has longer lifespans? Can paper be recycled 100%? Can paper bring new aesthetics for future architecture?
