"Book of Changes" records that the sky is Xuan and the earth is yellow. Xuan Pavilion pointed to the quiet and distant sky with the plank road extending upwards from the earth. Xuan is also an ancient word for hanging, which means that the extremely light structure supports the plank stairs and respects the original appearance of the site with a small intervention.

Looking at the Xuan Pavilion, the winding trails are reflected on the water, connecting the sky and the earth into one.

You can enter the scenic spot at the entrance pavilion when you walk on the floating road. The slender wooden pillars and diagonal braces form the overall structure, and when you climb up, it is like traveling through the forests with trunks.

The terraces on both sides of the north and south, which are connected by folding stairs, overlook the lakeside and the 
Yangtze River in the distance.

The observation station at the highest point, through the rising roof, 
looks into the higher heaven and earth, watching the clouds and rains dissipate, and the birds fly.

Concrete plinths are inserted into the wetland, and double layers of slender glulam columns sandwich the stairs and diagonal bracing to reinforce the structure as a whole. The wooden box bird watching station protruded from the top is gently held up by wooden pillars, which is also an important part of consolidating the structure.
