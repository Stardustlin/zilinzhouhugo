Summer and winter wind environment simulation before and after design
</div>

In terms of design, we mainly use L-shaped building blocks to build the unit form with the best ventilation effect for the wind environment in summer and winter. The ventilation holes left by the building blocks naturally grow under the unique wind and light environment of the site, forming an organic cloud module. The modules adopt different facade window opening strategies according to the ventilation requirements of different seasons and different functions.

In summer, the building has an open wind tunnel, forming a through wind, and the ventilation is smooth. The building is closed in winter, and the chimney effect is used to realize the atrium out of wind.

According to the different requirements of the site for ventilation and lighting in winter and summer, the algorithm of the metacellular automata is modified to establish the generation logic of the cloud block. In a position with a better view, we design a sky garden. The central location of each floor surrounds the corridor along the atrium, with simple and clear circulations.

The design of the facade grille is based on variability, and by adjusting the angle of the sun visor, it is possible to achieve a comfortable level of daylight illumination throughout the year. This study uses radiance as a tool and takes the southwest facade of the building as an example to simulate the daylight value of a single room on the standard floor.
