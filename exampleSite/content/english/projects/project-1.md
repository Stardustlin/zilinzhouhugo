**This is a collaboration of architecture with bio-structure and a manifesto for an exploratory revolution in structure and space.**

The exploration of new structures faithful to material properties always create wonderful spatial experiences. Nowadays, a group of scholars have turned to cross-border research in the field of biology and architecture. They hope to optimize structures and create new spatial patterns through inspirations from nature.

Inspired by Monica Ponce de Leon, I studied tree growth in the project to explore the possibility of future skyscrapers and hoped to solve two major problems: the excessive waste of materials in construction and the tedious space mode dominated by core tubes. Through form-finding of tree branches and evaluations of topology optimization, a spatial prototype for high-rise buildings came into being. 

This project attempts on the possibility of a future modern city comprised of high-rises organically grown into a forest system, by free connections between each other that provide most adaptable space for generations of people.

Though the research on 4 interior structures and 5 exterior structures for highrises, this project discovers the development of high-rise structure and their influences on plan layouts. What if the structure can bring new spatial experience and transportation for highrises?  Inspired by the study of tree growth, three features are extracted: the branch, the trunk and the root, respectively transformed into a possible high-rise structure.

Through form-finding of tree branches and the evaluations on topology optimization, a spatial prototype for high-rise buildings has been discovered. The concrete core tubes are re-assembled to four corners to make the structure stable. Optimized branches could connect the outer skins and inner transits to strengthen the whole structures as a whole.

The new transportation system is integrated into this structure: vertical elevators are placed in the four reinforced concrete corners, escalators in the inner branches and escape stairs in the outer branches. Such transportation design renders the inner spaces more liberated and fIexible.
