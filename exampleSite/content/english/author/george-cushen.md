I studied Architecture at Nanjing University in China and gained the recognition of outstanding graduate. Now, Iâ€™m studying at Delft University of Technology, with the Sino-Dutch Bilateral Exchange Scholarship in 2020-2022. I have worked in Roboticplus.AI (Shanghai) Co Ltd, LanD Studio, BEtween Architects as a parametric designer, exhibition designer, and architect.

My passions are in intelligent design and robotic fabrication. I believe my manifesto of Returning to Cross-border Architecture. Architecture design is not only a foray into limited knowledge, but it is also an exploration of the unknown to find new design principles.
