  content: "I studied Architecture at Nanjing University in China and gained the recognition
    of outstanding graduate. Now, I'm studying at Delft University of Technology,
    with the Sino-Dutch Bilateral Exchange Scholarship in 2020-2022. I have worked
    in Roboticplus.AI (Shanghai) Co Ltd, LanD Studio, BEtween Architects as a parametric
    designer, exhibition designer, and architect. \n\n\nMy passions are in intelligent
    design and robotic fabrication. I believe my manifesto of Returning to Cross-border
    Architecture. Architecture design is not only a foray into limited knowledge,
    but it is also an exploration of the unknown to find new design principles."
